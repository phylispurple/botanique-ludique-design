-- Fix SELECT policy on user_roles: restrict to authenticated and use direct UUID comparison
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own roles" ON public.user_roles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own roles"
  ON public.user_roles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
